# `GlobalLife`

A 3D rendered globe and data visualization demo using D3.js and Three.js. The globe can rotated with an intuitive mouse drag, and can be hovered on to display the hovered over country, as well as 'clicked' to select the country that is being hovered over. Clicking the country causes the page to render some bar graphs and pie charts representing data from various sources, such as the Happiness Index from 2019, and as an example, how much of the land area is devoted to crops.
